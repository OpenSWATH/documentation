Getting Started
===============

.. note::

   OpenSWATH is part of the OpenMS project, therefore if you install OpenMS you will get OpenSWATH automatically. Please refer to our `installation instructions <binaries.html>`_.

To get started with the DIA or SWATH-MS analysis, we recommend to follow the
recently published step-for-step tutorial [1]_ describing a complete OpenSWATH
analysis workflow using ``OpenSwathWorkflow`` available from `bioRxiv
<http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/03/19/044552>`_.  In addition, you can
find in-depth information about the different tools in a SWATH analysis on this page.

Tutorial Data
-------------

You can access the tutorial data (a *M. tuberculosis* dataset) used in the 
2017 Methods Mol Biol. OpenSWATH tutorial [1]_ 
`here <http://www.peptideatlas.org/PASS/PASS00779>`_. The data contains

- 3 mzML instrument data files (centroided)
- 3 WIFF raw instrument data files 
- Mtb assay library (for OpenMS 2.1)
- Mtb assay library (for older OpenMS)
- Swath windows file for analysis
- iRT assay file (TraML format)


Questions?
