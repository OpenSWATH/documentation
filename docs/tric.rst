TRIC
=========

Overview
--------

TRIC [1]_ is an alignment software for targeted proteomics (SRM or SWATH-MS) data. TRIC uses a graph-based alignment strategy based on non-linear retention time correction to integrate information from all available runs. The input consists of a set of csv files derived from a targeted proteomics experiment generated by OpenSWATH (using either mProphet or PyProphet) or generated by Peakview.

There are two basic running modes available. The first one uses a reference-based alignment where a single run is chosen as a reference and all other runs are aligned to it. This is a useful choice for a small number of runs that are chromatographically similar. The second mode generates a guidance tree based on chromatographic similarity of the input runs and uses this tree to align the targeted proteomics runs (the nodes in the tree are runs and the edges are pairwise alignments). Generally this mode is better for a large number of runs or for chromatographically dissimilar samples.

Contact and Support
-------------------

We provide support for TRIC on the `GitHub repository
<https://github.com/msproteomicstools/msproteomicstools/issues>`_.

Tutorial
--------
After installing TRIC, please familiarize yourself with the `TRIC Tutorial
<https://github.com/msproteomicstools/msproteomicstools/blob/master/TRIC-README.md>`_. All command line parameters and their effects are explained in the tutorial and the associated tutorial paper (Röst et al). Currently, the recommended parameters for TRIC are:

.. code-block:: bash

   feature_alignment.py 
   --in file1_input.csv file2_input.csv file3_input.csv 
   --out aligned.csv 
   --method LocalMST --realign_method lowess_cython --max_rt_diff 60 
   --mst:useRTCorrection True --mst:Stdev_multiplier 3.0 
   --target_fdr 0.01 --max_fdr_quality 0.05 

An extended tutorial describing a complete OpenSWATH analysis workflow including TRIC was recently published [2]_ and is also available from `bioRxiv
<http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/03/19/044552>`_.
