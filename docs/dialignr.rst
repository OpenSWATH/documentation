DIAlignR
=========

Overview
--------

DIAlignR [1]_ is an R package for retention time alignment of targeted mass spectrometric data, including DIA and SWATH-MS data. This tool works with MS2 chromatograms directly and uses dynamic programming for alignment of raw chromatographic traces. DIAlignR uses a hybrid approach of global (feature-based) and local (raw data-based) alignment to establish correspondence between peaks.
