SWATHAtlas
=========

Overview
--------

`SWATHAtlas
<http://www.swathatlas.org>`_ is a repository providing spectral libraries generated from endogeneous samples and synthetic peptides. The libraries are preformatted for several commonly employed targeted data analysis tools, e.g. OpenSWATH, Skyline, Spectronaut and PeakView.

Contact and Support
-------------------

The libraries are processed by different tools and we thus provide support via different channels. If you encounter problems with obtaining the libraries, please contact the SWATHAtlas team, e.g. via the `TPP Support Group
<http://groups.google.com/group/spctools-discuss>`_.

For support regarding ``spectrast2tsv.py``, please use the `msproteomicstools
<https://github.com/msproteomicstools/msproteomicstools/issues>`_ issue tracker or consider the support channels for the `OpenMS
<http://www.openms.de/support/>`_ components of the workflow.
